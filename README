CMACs in Python

Version: 1.0

This is a standalone Python module that implements CMACS. The
implementation relies on Pythons own internal hashing methods to
implement the algorithm in a simple "Pythonic" way. Below the CMAC
class an example that learns the 3d structure of a wave surface is
included and should serve as an out of the box test that you have the
necessary prerequisites (numpy and matplotlib) to run this code.

A setup.py script is included that allows for easy installation.

CMACs are useful function approximation methods but suffer from
problems if the dimensionality of the input data is large.

Requires: numpy, pylab
